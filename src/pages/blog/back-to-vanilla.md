Take away pre-processors, and tons of code to accomplish everyday layouts or grids. CSS is coming to an age that feels refreshing. We have far more control, and it's usually only one line to make changes happen.

This feature is old but vanilla CSS variables are something that replaces third party variables using sass for colors, fonts, etc.

Clamp() is massive for fluid type, and media queries riddled in a codebase.

Container queries are coming, which take away using JS to target dimensions for an individual section since all we were able to control before was an entire viewport.

don't talk about the current stack or how behind you may feel, things are good and you're ready to learn and keep progressing
