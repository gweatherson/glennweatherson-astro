			<p>Hi there! ü´°</p>

			<p>My name is Glenn Weatherson, which hopefully is clear by now.</p>

			<p>I'm a web developer with many moons of industry experience who is currently working at <a href="https://970design.com">970 Design</a>. Most of my career has been building websites using Wordpress, among other tooling. I find joy in working through the process of turning a new design or idea into a coded, usable experience, especially when there are new things to try along the way.</p>

			<p>Some notable client work I've been a part of includes GoPro, Nike, Tahiti, Yosemite, Pokemon, and more.</p>

			<p>While not working, I'm usually pedaling any sort of bicycle, playing video games, digging for new sounds I haven't heard of yet, spending time with my partner, or trying to wear our dogs out. Or, I'm doing absolutely nothing, because that's just as important. üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

			<p>Oh yeah, I put photos up on <a href="https://glennscrap.com">glennscrap.com</a></p>
